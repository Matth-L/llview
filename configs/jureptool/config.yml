# JURI uses Jureptool to create html and pdf reports
# Jureptool relies plotly and jquery to build the html pages
# The required javascript files for plotly and jquery are located in:
# JURI/js/ext, (https://github.com/FZJ-JSC/JURI/tree/main/js/ext)
#
# Set the option below to true if you want to use the CDN for jquery and plotly
# Enabling this allows Jureptool to generate HTML files without requiring JURI.
# CDN = Content Delivery Network
use_cdn: false
cdn_jquery: 'https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js'
cdn_plotly: 'https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-latest.min.js'

# otherwise, if you want to use it locally without relying on JURI,
# you can add the jquery.min.js and the plotly.min.js
# ex : jquery_path: 'foo/bar/jquery.min.js'

# If you leave these as null:
#   - Jureptool will automatically use the built-in copies from JURI/js/ext
#   - Or, if `use_cdn` is set to True, the CDN versions of jquery and plotly will be used.
